# CI-CD-Challenge

The 3 main tasks that I will be taking on in this challenge are:

1) Create a simple REST API and package within a simple deployment
framework/pipeline.

2) Commit changes to a git repo and share the repo link.

3) Make sure the repo contains a README file that contains any assumptions you
may have made, and any instructions for getting the resulting environment up and
running.


My biggest challenge would be creating a REST API for the first time since my experience with them has only been consuming them. The next would be creating my first Docker contained app and integrating it into a pipeline. 


<h1>Assumptions:</h1>
Using Github is an acceptable form of git.


Steps to Run:
1. Once you have downloaded the repo, change your directory to be inside of it.
2. Run the following command to activate the virtual environment:
	```
	source .venv/Scripts/activate
	```
3. set the Flask app name and env with the following commands:
	```
	export FLASK_APP=application.py
	export FLASK_ENV=development
	```
3. Run the app with
	```			
	flask run
	```
