# CI-CD-Challenge

The 3 main tasks that I will be taking on in this challenge are:

1) Create a simple REST API and package within a simple deployment
framework/pipeline.

2) Commit changes to a git repo and share the repo link with us.

3) Make sure the repo contains a README file that contains any assumptions you
may have made, and any instructions for getting the resulting environment up and
running.


My biggest challenge would be creating a REST API for the first time since my experience with them has only been consuming them. The next would be creating my first Docker contained app and integrating it into a pipeline.
